  "description": "I am a professional in designing logos and brand identities with more than five years of freelancing under my belt, having experience with a wide variety of clients, both startups and family-run establishments and large-scale brands. I believe that I am a pressure person, and I excel on tight deadlines as well as complicated projects, without providing anything generic. My logo design philosophy centres on boldly memorable brand identities, attention-getting, telling your unique story, and mixing creative imagination with strategy and market research to make your brand stand out. I am not into cookie-cutter designs that you can forget tomorrow; your brand is not that type of brand. With a successful history of working with new ventures to industry heavyweights, I am a focused, detail-orientated, reliable person and driven by challenging work. I will also ensure that I am providing quality services (creative) which will put some energy and originality in each project and make your brand stand out in the competitive world.",
